# Altium Designer Integrated Components Library
[Altium Designer](http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview) Components collected through many years. 3D models downloaded from different Authors and sources like:

1. [3D Content Central](http://www.3dcontentcentral.com/).
2. [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library).
3. [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).

In many cases original STEP models provided by distributors / manufacturers were included.

Compiled Integrated Libraries can be found in the 'Output' directory. Components are segregated (in most cases) according to categories in the [Transfer Multisort Electronics](http://www.tme.eu/pl/) catalogue.

# Example projects designed with the components.
3D PDFs exported form Altium Designer can be found in the '_samples' directory of this repo.
